    "question": "What is the ultimate fate of the universe according to current cosmological models?",
    "options": [
      "It will collapse back into a singularity (Big Crunch)",
      "It will expand forever and reach a state of maximum entropy (Heat Death)",
      "It will stop expanding and remain in equilibrium",
      "It will oscillate between expansion and contraction"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "category": "Future of the Universe",
    "explanation": "The most widely accepted model suggests that the universe will continue expanding until it reaches a state of maximum entropy, also known as 'heat death'."

    "question": "What is the primary evidence supporting the existence of dark matter?",
    "options": [
      "The cosmic microwave background radiation",
      "The orbits of stars in galaxies",
      "The expansion of the universe",
      "The detection of gravitational waves"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "category": "Dark Matter",
    "explanation": "The motion of stars in galaxies suggests that there is more mass present than can be accounted for by visible matter alone, indicating the presence of dark matter."

    "question": "What is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)?",
    "options": [
      "A type of electromagnetic radiation emitted by stars",
      "The afterglow of the Big Bang",
      "A form of dark matter",
      "The radiation from black holes"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "category": "Big Bang Theory",
    "explanation": "The CMB is the residual thermal radiation from the Big Bang, providing key evidence for the early state of the universe."
