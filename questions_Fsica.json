    "question": "What is Newton's First Law of Motion?",
    "options": [
      "An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.",
      "The force on an object is equal to its mass times acceleration.",
      "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
      "Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed."
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "category": "Classical Mechanics",
    "explanation": "Newton's First Law, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or move uniformly unless acted upon by an external force."

    "question": "What happens to the pressure of a gas if its volume decreases while temperature remains constant (Boyle's Law)?",
    "options": [
      "The pressure increases",
      "The pressure decreases",
      "The pressure remains constant",
      "The temperature decreases"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "category": "Thermodynamics",
    "explanation": "Boyle's Law states that for a fixed amount of gas at constant temperature, the pressure is inversely proportional to its volume."
